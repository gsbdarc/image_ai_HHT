Description:
This script contains a collection of utility functions for processing images and preparing data for fine-tuning GPT models, specifically for tasks like identifying the year of cars in images. The functions cover various steps such as encoding images, extracting years from class names and responses, computing accuracy, preparing datasets, and more.

    Processes a DataFrame containing model responses to extract content and years.

    This function performs post-processing on a DataFrame that contains the raw JSON responses from a GPT model. It extracts the 'content' field from each response, parses it to retrieve the textual content, and then extracts years mentioned in that content using the `extract_years_from_content` function. The extracted content and years are added as new columns to the DataFrame.

    Returns:

    Extracts all four-digit years and year ranges from a given text content.

    This function scans the input text for patterns that represent years (e.g., "2012")
    and year ranges (e.g., "2010-2012", "from 2010 to 2012", "between 2010 and 2012").
    It accounts for various ways years and ranges might be mentioned in the text,
    including different delimiters and phrasing.

    Parameters:
    - content (str): The text content from which to extract years and year ranges.

    Returns:
    - years_list (list of str): A sorted list of unique years (as strings) extracted from the content.

    Notes:
    - The function handles years in the range from 1900 to 2099.
    - For year ranges, all years within the range are included in the output list.
    - Duplicate years are removed, and the final list is sorted in ascending order.
    - The function is useful for parsing textual responses where years are mentioned
      in various formats, ensuring comprehensive extraction of relevant years.
